        We will create a data management system for the University of Gravity
        Falls website back-end. This university has a capacity of about 1000
        students and about 100 teachers. This database aims to utilize the
        resource, storing data and data security. For example, the admission
        office can add more students to the university as acceptance, students
        could look up their courses, teachers could keep a graded record of
        students, and non-student could not randomly access university
        information.
